# NuPlug

Plugin management powered by NuGet.

## What is it?

The idea of using NuGet for plugin management is not new. Visual Studio manages its extensions with NuGet, JetBrains ReSharper does it. As we can find, the idea dates back to 2011 when Matt Hamilton announced that [Comictser uses NuGet for plugins](http://matthamilton.net/nuget-for-plug-ins)
